## Problem Statement

The lack of structured and technology-driven recycling systems in Dhaka results in excessive waste mismanagement and inefficiency in material reuse. Households and businesses generate large amounts of recyclable materials, yet no efficient system exists to facilitate their collection, processing, and distribution. Additionally, businesses that use recycled materials struggle to source them reliably.

**ShunnoWaste** is designed as a smart recycling management system that integrates digital tracking, automated inventory management, and a structured rewards mechanism to encourage recycling. By leveraging software-driven automation, this system ensures efficient material flow between users and businesses while promoting sustainable practices.

## Objectives
1. Develop a web-based platform for users to submit recyclable materials, track submission history, and earn rewards through a points-based system.
2. Provide businesses with a streamlined platform to browse available recycled materials, place orders, and track purchase history.
3. Create a robust admin interface to manage user accounts, oversee stock levels, and generate performance reports.
4. Implement a feature to help users locate nearby collection booths.
